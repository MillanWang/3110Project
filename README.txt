Changes since last version:
	-Applied the received feedback for the Milestone2 submission. 
	-Implemented the logic behind the AIPlayer, so it can play the game as a real player
	-Implemented the logic behind the Fortify stage, so now the players can move troops.
	-Thoroughly tested the GUI implementation
	-Added the extra JUnit tests

KNOWN ISSUES:
	-The AI Player is unlikely to win against the competent players (Milestone 3)
	-MVC Pattern is not followed perfectly

FUTURE PLANS:
	Milestone 4 - December 7th 2020
		-Applying the received feedback for the Milestone3 submission. 
		-Implement the save and load features.
		-Implement the logic behind allowing the user to load his own custome maps 
		-Thorough testing of the GUI implementation
